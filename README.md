# TensorGP
A multiway analysis tool in under construction.

- `tensor_gaussian` contains fundamental functions for mulitlinear Gaussian distributions (see [Ohlson et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmva.2011.05.015)). It has teh MLE-3D estimator for component covariance matrices.
- `totreg.py` contains tensor-on-tensor regression proposed by [Lock (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2017.1401544).
